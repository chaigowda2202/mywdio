Provides detailed logs for debugging, but less verbose than trace.
Includes command execution details and responses.

info:

Logs general information about the test execution.
Includes successful commands and significant events.
Use Case: Default level for normal test execution to track key activities.
warn:

error:

Logs only errors that occur during test execution.
Use Case: To focus on critical issues during tests.
